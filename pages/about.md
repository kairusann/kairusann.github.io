*Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020*

“Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020” (PMA2020) is a five-year project that contributes to a global monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for family planning and provides rich information useful for reporting, planning, operational decisions and advocacy at the community, country and global levels. See website for the detail.

*National Lakes Assessment 2012: A Collaborative Survey of Lakes in the United States*

The National Lakes Assessment (NLA) is a statistical survey of the condition of our nation's lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. It is designed to provide information on the extent of lakes that support healthy biological condition and recreation, estimate how widespread major stressors are that impact lake quality, and provide insight into whether lakes nationwide are getting cleaner.

*Instant Climate Response to Doubled Black Carbon Emission in 1800-1999*

A GCM climate model (GFDL CM2.1) is used to study the climate response to an instantaneous doubling of black carbon in 1800 – 1999. Simulated results from the controlled case and doubled black carbon case were compared. The global and regional climatology such as temperature, precipitation and evaporation rate are analyzed and discussed. The black carbon causes mostly regional effect rather than global effect might due to its short-lived in the atmosphere.

*Understanding the Effect of Meteorology and Air Pollution in Visibility Reduction*

This study applies eight popular statistical learning models (GLM, GAM, MARS, SVM, CART, Random Forest, BART and ANN) on meteorology and air quality data collected from Hong Kong. Predictors include local meteorology and key air pollutant concentrations. Variable importance from different model on visibility reduction was compared and discussed.
